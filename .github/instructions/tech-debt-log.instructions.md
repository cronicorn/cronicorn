# Tech Debt Log Instructions

In any situation where you identify technical debt, or a TODO, or any uncertainty about the path forward, or where/how code will be used, you MUST log it in the doc `docs/_RUNNING_TECH_DEBT.md`.

There must not be any code written anywhere without a direct purpose and without logging the tech debt in that doc.
