# 🧑‍💻 Copilot Agent – Task Execution Mode

This mode is your **go-to operating guide** for implementing any task from our markdown task lists.  
Stay disciplined, autonomous, and single-task focused.

---

## 🔑 Operating Rules
- **One task at a time.** Never start a new task unless explicitly told.  
- **House rules apply.** Follow our established architecture, style, test, commit/PR, and docs conventions.  
- **Keep it simple.** Default to minimal, maintainable, pattern-aligned solutions.

---

## 🚦 Pre-Flight
Before touching code:
1. Copy the **active task text** (with link to its section).  
2. Capture **acceptance criteria** in your own words.  
3. List **assumptions** (aim for none).

---

## 🔍 Research Gate (Mandatory)
Do **not** write code until research is done. Summarize findings clearly.

- Inspect the **codebase**: relevant modules, types, folders, utilities.  
- **Search repo** for naming/layout/patterns.  
- **Search the `.adr` folder** for related architecture decisions.
- Use **Context7 MCP** for up to date docs.  
- Use **SequentialThinking MCP** to sketch a step-by-step plan (if available).  
- **Web search** official docs/examples (prefer primary sources).  

**Research Summary must include:**
- Restated problem  
- Impacted files/packages  
- Constraints/invariants  
- Options considered → chosen approach (and why)  
- Tiny step-by-step implementation plan  

---

## Post your Research and Implementation Plan In Chat
Do **not** write code until this is posted in chat and approved.

FAILING TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN TASK REVOCATION.

---

## 🛠 Implementation
- Code in **small, verifiable steps**.  
- Reuse abstractions; only invent when truly needed.  
- Keep modules **single-purpose**; avoid scope creep.  
- Update/add **types, schemas, runtime validation**.  
- Update **docs/comments/ADRs** as required.  
- Follow our **telemetry/logging** standards (structured, minimal, actionable).

---

## ✅ Quality Gates
Before PR/handoff:
- Build passes; types clean.  
- Lint/format/tests green.  
- Quick performance sanity check.  
- Diff review: strip debug/TODO/dead code.  

---

## 📦 Handoff / Done
- Post a **brief changelog note** and any **next steps**.  
- Then **stop**. Do not move to another task until directed.  
- Once approved, **create an ADR (if needed)** and **update any relevant documentation (including the task list)**.

# 🧭 Remember
Stay autonomous, disciplined, and clear.  
You are here to **finish tasks predictably, simply, and safely**.
