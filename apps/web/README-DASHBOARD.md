# Dashboard UI Implementation

## Overview

The dashboard UI has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### Files Created

1. **`src/routes/dashboard.tsx`** - Main dashboard page
   - Displays aggregated statistics in card format
   - Shows time-series chart of run activity
   - Lists top endpoints by run count
   - Shows recent runs across all jobs
   
2. **`src/components/dashboard/DashboardChart.tsx`** - Time series chart component
   - Uses recharts Area chart with stacked success/failure data
   - Responsive design with proper formatting
   - Custom tooltips and gradients

3. **`src/components/dashboard/TopEndpointsTable.tsx`** - Top endpoints table
   - Shows top 5 endpoints sorted by run count
   - Displays success rate with color-coded indicators
   - Includes job name and last run time

4. **`src/components/dashboard/RecentRunsList.tsx`** - Recent runs feed
   - Lists most recent 50 runs (showing 10 on dashboard)
   - Status badges with icons (success, failure, timeout, cancelled)
   - Relative timestamps and duration formatting
   - Shows run source (baseline-cron, ai-interval, etc)

### Integration

- **Query Client**: Added `@tanstack/react-query` QueryClientProvider to `main.tsx`
- **Navigation**: Updated Header component with Dashboard link
- **Data Fetching**: Uses `dashboardStatsQueryOptions` with 7-day default
- **Auth**: Route will require authentication (handled by API middleware)

## Features

### Stats Cards
- **Total Jobs**: Count of all user's jobs
- **Endpoints**: Total count with active/paused breakdown
- **Success Rate**: Overall percentage with trend indicator (↑/↓/→)
- **24h Activity**: Run count with success/failure breakdown

### Trend Indicators
- **Up (Green)**: Success rate improved by >2% compared to previous period
- **Down (Red)**: Success rate declined by >2% compared to previous period
- **Stable (Gray)**: Success rate within ±2% range

### Chart
- 7-day time series showing stacked success/failure runs
- Interactive tooltips with formatted dates
- Responsive design adapts to screen size

### Top Endpoints Table
- Ranked by total run count
- Color-coded success rate badges:
  - Green (≥90%): Healthy
  - Yellow (50-89%): Warning
  - Red (<50%): Critical
- Shows parent job name and last run timestamp

### Recent Runs Feed
- Scrollable list of latest runs
- Status icons and color-coded badges
- Relative time formatting (e.g., "2h ago", "Just now")
- Duration in ms or seconds
- Source label (what triggered the run)

## Usage

### Accessing the Dashboard

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

// Navigate to dashboard
<Link to="/dashboard">View Dashboard</Link>

// Or programmatically
navigate({ to: "/dashboard" });
```

### Customizing Time Range

```tsx
// In dashboard.tsx, change the days parameter
const { data } = useQuery(dashboardStatsQueryOptions({ days: 30 })); // Last 30 days
```

### Loading States

The dashboard shows:
- Loading spinner while fetching data
- Error message if API call fails
- Empty states if no data exists

## API Integration

The dashboard consumes the `/api/dashboard/stats` endpoint:

```typescript
GET /api/dashboard/stats?days=7

Response:
{
  jobs: { total: number },
  endpoints: { total: number, active: number, paused: number },
  successRate: { overall: number, trend: "up" | "down" | "stable" },
  recentActivity: { runs24h: number, success24h: number, failure24h: number },
  runTimeSeries: Array<{ date: string, success: number, failure: number }>,
  topEndpoints: Array<{ id, name, jobName, successRate, lastRunAt, runCount }>,
  recentRuns: Array<{ id, endpointId, endpointName, jobName, status, startedAt, durationMs, source }>
}
```

## Styling

- Uses Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Responsive grid layout (1 col mobile, 2 cols tablet, 4 cols desktop)
- Lucide React icons for consistent iconography
- Color scheme:
  - Blue: Jobs
  - Purple: Endpoints
  - Green: Success metrics
  - Orange: Activity metrics
  - Red: Failures

## Next Steps

1. **Add Filtering**: Allow users to filter by job or endpoint
2. **Date Range Picker**: Let users select custom time ranges
3. **Real-time Updates**: Add polling or websocket updates
4. **Drill-down Navigation**: Click endpoint to view details
5. **Export Data**: Allow CSV/JSON export of metrics
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhance touch interactions

## Testing

To test the dashboard:

1. Ensure API server is running with authentication
2. Create some jobs and endpoints
3. Run endpoints to generate data
4. Navigate to `/dashboard` route
5. Verify all stats display correctly

## Troubleshooting

### No data showing
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check API endpoint returns valid data
- Inspect browser console for errors

### Chart not rendering
- Ensure recharts is installed: `pnpm add recharts`
- Check that `runTimeSeries` data is in correct format

### Build errors
- Run `pnpm install` to ensure all dependencies are present
- Check TypeScript compiler with `pnpm build`
