  // Enhanced FAQ for AI Optimization & Voice Search
  faq: {
    primary: [
      {
        question: "What happens when my cron jobs fail at 3 AM?",
        answer: "Cronicorn's AI automatically detects failures and triggers intelligent recovery. Our system analyzes failure patterns, sends instant alerts, and can automatically retry with optimized timing. You'll never wake up to broken deployments again.",
        category: "reliability"
      },
      {
        question: "How does AI scheduling work for enterprise applications?",
        answer: "Our AI learns from your job execution patterns, dependencies, and system load. It automatically adjusts timing to prevent conflicts, optimizes resource usage, and predicts the best execution windows based on historical performance data.",
        category: "ai-features"
      },
      {
        question: "Can Cronicorn handle complex multi-server deployments?",
        answer: "Yes! Cronicorn is built for enterprise scale. We support distributed job execution, cross-server dependencies, load balancing, and automatic failover. Our platform manages thousands of jobs across multiple environments simultaneously.",
        category: "enterprise"
      },
      {
        question: "Why do traditional cron jobs break during traffic spikes?",
        answer: "Traditional cron runs on fixed schedules regardless of system load. During traffic spikes, additional cron jobs can overwhelm your servers. Cronicorn's AI monitors system health and intelligently delays or reschedules jobs to prevent resource conflicts.",

      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between Cronicorn and other scheduling tools?",
        answer: "Unlike static schedulers, Cronicorn uses real-time AI to optimize job timing. We provide predictive analytics, automatic error recovery, and intelligent resource management that traditional tools can't match.",
        category: "comparison"
      },
      {
        question: "Does Cronicorn work with Kubernetes and Docker?",
        answer: "Absolutely! Cronicorn integrates seamlessly with containerized environments. We support Kubernetes CronJobs, Docker containers, and cloud-native architectures with native API integrations.",
        category: "integration"
      },
      {
