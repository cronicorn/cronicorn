# Stripe Subscription Integration

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The adaptive AI scheduler requires a monetization strategy to sustain operations and align AI token quotas with subscription tiers. We needed a billing system that:

1. **Supports tiered subscriptions**: Free, Pro, and Enterprise plans with different feature limits
2. **Integrates with existing tier-based quotas**: Subscription tier determines execution limits (endpoints, intervals) and AI token budgets
3. **Handles subscription lifecycle**: Checkout, upgrades/downgrades, cancellations, payment failures
4. **Maintains clean architecture**: Payment provider as a domain port, Stripe as an adapter
5. **Minimal API surface**: Internal billing endpoints for web app only (not part of public API)

We evaluated several approaches:
- **Self-hosted billing**: Too complex, requires PCI compliance, payment gateway integrations
- **Stripe**: Industry standard, handles compliance, mature webhook system
- **Paddle/Chargebee**: Similar to Stripe but less adoption, more opinionated

We chose **Stripe** for its:
- Comprehensive API and SDKs
- Robust webhook infrastructure for async event handling
- Customer Portal (managed UI for subscription changes)
- Strong TypeScript support
- Wide adoption (proven reliability)

## Decision

We implemented a **webhook-driven subscription system** with Stripe as the payment provider, following hexagonal architecture principles.

### Architecture

**Domain Port** (`packages/domain/src/ports/payment.ts`):

```typescript
export interface IPaymentProvider {
  // Checkout flow
  createCheckoutSession(params: CheckoutSessionParams): Promise<CheckoutSessionResult>;
  
  // Customer portal (self-service subscription management)
  createPortalSession(params: PortalSessionParams): Promise<PortalSessionResult>;
  
  // Webhook verification and event handling
  verifyWebhook(rawBody: string, signature: string, secret: string): Promise<WebhookEvent>;
  
  // Price ID → tier mapping (reverse lookup)
  getTierFromPriceId(priceId: string): UserTier;
}
```

**Key types**: `CheckoutSessionParams`, `WebhookEvent`, `UserTier` ("free" | "pro" | "enterprise")

**Adapter** (`packages/adapter-stripe/src/stripe-client.ts`):

Full Stripe SDK integration implementing `IPaymentProvider`:
- `createCheckoutSession()`: Creates Stripe checkout with product price, attaches userId in metadata
- `createPortalSession()`: Generates Customer Portal URL for subscription management
- `verifyWebhook()`: Uses `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()` for HMAC signature verification
- `getTierFromPriceId()`: Maps Stripe price IDs to tier enum values (hardcoded for MVP)

**Service Layer** (`packages/services/src/subscriptions/manager.ts`):

`SubscriptionsManager` orchestrates business logic:
- **`createCheckout(userId, tier)`**: Creates/reuses Stripe customer, generates checkout URL with metadata
- **`createPortal(userId)`**: Validates user has active subscription, returns portal URL
- **`getSubscriptionStatus(userId)`**: Returns current tier, status, and period end date
- **`handleWebhookEvent(event)`**: Routes webhook events to specialized handlers

**Webhook Handlers** (5 event types):
1. `checkout.session.completed`: After successful payment → upgrade user tier, store customer/subscription IDs
2. `customer.subscription.updated`: When subscription changes → update tier, status, period end
3. `customer.subscription.deleted`: When subscription ends → downgrade to free tier
4. `invoice.payment_succeeded`: When payment processes → mark subscription active
5. `invoice.payment_failed`: When payment fails → mark subscription past_due

**API Routes** (`apps/api/src/routes/subscriptions/`):

Three internal endpoints (hidden from OpenAPI docs):
- `POST /api/subscriptions/checkout` - Create checkout session (requires auth)
- `POST /api/subscriptions/portal` - Generate customer portal URL (requires auth)
- `GET /api/subscriptions/status` - Get current subscription status (requires auth)

Webhook endpoint (public, signature-verified):
- `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` - Receive Stripe events

**Schema Changes** (`packages/adapter-drizzle/migrations/0005_add_stripe_subscription_fields.sql`):

Added 4 fields to `user` table:
- `stripe_customer_id TEXT` - Stripe customer reference (reused across subscriptions)
- `stripe_subscription_id TEXT` - Current active subscription ID
- `subscription_status TEXT` - "active" | "past_due" | "canceled" | "incomplete"
- `subscription_ends_at TIMESTAMP` - Period end date (for cancel_at_period_end handling)

### Key Design Choices

**1. Webhook-driven architecture instead of polling**

Why:
- Stripe sends events immediately (sub-second latency)
- No need to poll Stripe API for status changes
- Events are retried automatically on failure
- Lower API costs (no periodic polling)

Implementation:
- Webhook endpoint verifies signature before processing
- Handler routes events to specialized methods
- Database updated atomically per webhook

Tradeoff: Requires webhook endpoint accessible to Stripe (public or tunneled in dev).

**2. Customer Portal for self-service subscription management**

Why:
- Stripe-hosted UI for updating payment methods, viewing invoices, canceling subscriptions
- Saves ~200 lines of custom UI code
- PCI-compliant by default (no card data touches our servers)
- Professional UX maintained by Stripe

Setup: One-time configuration in Stripe Dashboard (enable features, customize branding).

Tradeoff: Less customization control, must redirect users to Stripe domain.

**3. Metadata-driven user mapping (not Stripe's native user system)**

Why:
- We control user identity (Better Auth handles OAuth + API keys)
- Stripe customer is just a billing record, not primary user
- Metadata (`userId`) links Stripe customer ↔ our user table

Implementation:
- Checkout sessions include `metadata: { userId }`
- Webhooks extract userId from metadata
- Database queries join on `stripe_customer_id`

Consequence: Must always include userId in metadata, or webhook fails silently.

**4. Hardcoded price ID → tier mapping (not database-driven)**

Why:
- MVP has only 2 paid tiers (Pro, Enterprise)
- Price IDs are environment variables (test vs production)
- Avoids additional `pricing_plans` table

Implementation:
```typescript
getTierFromPriceId(priceId: string): UserTier {
  if (priceId === this.proPriceId) return "pro";
  if (priceId === this.enterprisePriceId) return "enterprise";
  return "free"; // Fallback for unknown prices
}
```

Tradeoff: Adding new tiers requires code deployment. Future: migrate to `pricing_plans` table.

**5. Hidden from OpenAPI docs (internal endpoints only)**

Why:
- Subscription routes are for web app, not public API consumers
- Prevents confusion in API documentation (job scheduling is the product, not subscriptions)
- No need for auto-generated TypeScript client

Implementation:
- Used `router.post()` instead of `router.openapi()` in Hono routes
- Manual Zod schema validation in handlers
- Endpoints still require authentication

Consequence: Web app uses Zod schemas directly for type safety (no generated client).

**6. Cancel_at_period_end behavior (not immediate downgrade)**

Why:
- Industry standard SaaS pattern (user retains access until period ends)
- Better UX (no surprise mid-month downgrades)
- Stripe sets `cancel_at_period_end=true` by default in Customer Portal

Implementation:
- `subscription.deleted` webhook only fires when subscription actually ends
- Until then, tier stays active
- `subscription_ends_at` stored for future grace period checks

Current limitation: Tier checks don't validate `subscription_ends_at` yet (immediate downgrade on webhook). Future enhancement needed.

**7. Webhook signature verification with Hono raw body**

Critical security requirement: Stripe webhooks must verify HMAC signature to prevent spoofing.

Challenge discovered:
- Hono's `c.req.json()` consumes request stream (can't re-read for signature)
- `c.req.arrayBuffer()` breaks UTF-8 encoding (signature mismatch)
- `c.req.raw.text()` also failed verification

Solution (from Hono docs):
```typescript
const body = await c.req.text(); // Preserves exact raw bytes
const signature = c.req.header("stripe-signature");
const event = await paymentProvider.verifyWebhook(body, signature, webhookSecret);
```

**Why this works**: `c.req.text()` in Hono preserves the exact request body needed for HMAC validation.

Lesson: Always consult framework documentation for webhook patterns.

### Integration with Tier-Based Quotas

Subscription tier determines quota limits (ADR-0021):

```typescript
// Domain constants
export const TIER_LIMITS = {
  free: 100_000,        // 100k tokens/month
  pro: 1_000_000,       // 1M tokens/month
  enterprise: 10_000_000 // 10M tokens/month
};

export const TIER_EXECUTION_LIMITS = {
  free: { maxEndpoints: 10, minIntervalMs: 60_000 },
  pro: { maxEndpoints: 100, minIntervalMs: 10_000 },
  enterprise: { maxEndpoints: 1_000, minIntervalMs: 1_000 }
};
```

When subscription tier changes (via webhook):
1. `SubscriptionsManager` updates `user.tier` in database
2. `QuotaGuard` queries `user.tier` to determine AI token limit
3. `JobsManager` queries `user.tier` to enforce endpoint count and interval limits

No special sync needed—tier is single source of truth.

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **Clean architecture**: Payment provider is a port, Stripe is swappable adapter  
✅ **Event-driven**: Webhooks ensure database stays in sync with Stripe  
✅ **Self-service**: Customer Portal reduces support burden  
✅ **Secure**: Signature verification prevents webhook spoofing  
✅ **Testable**: 23 unit tests (9 adapter + 14 service), 100% and 89.78% coverage  
✅ **Type-safe**: Zod schemas for all request/response validation  
✅ **Documented**: Comprehensive README with setup, troubleshooting, production checklist  

### Tradeoffs & Known Limitations

⚠️ **No webhook idempotency table**: Relies on Stripe SDK deduplication, duplicate events could theoretically cause issues (low risk, acceptable for MVP)

⚠️ **Hardcoded price → tier mapping**: Must deploy code to add new tiers (future: database-driven pricing table)

⚠️ **No subscription status enum in database**: `subscription_status` is `TEXT` instead of PostgreSQL enum (TypeScript enforces valid values, acceptable)

⚠️ **Immediate tier downgrade on cancellation**: Doesn't respect `subscription_ends_at` grace period (future enhancement: check period end in auth middleware)

⚠️ **Hidden from OpenAPI**: No auto-generated TypeScript client for subscription routes (intentional—web app uses Zod schemas directly)

⚠️ **Manual product setup**: Products/prices must be created in Stripe Dashboard before deployment (future: Terraform or setup script)

### Validation & Testing

**Unit Tests** (23 tests, all passing):
- `packages/adapter-stripe/src/__tests__/stripe-client.test.ts`: 9 tests covering checkout, portal, webhook verification, tier mapping
- `packages/services/src/subscriptions/__tests__/manager.test.ts`: 14 tests covering all 3 public methods and 5 webhook handlers

**Manual Integration Testing** (complete):
1. ✅ Checkout session creation and completion (test card 4242 4242 4242 4242)
2. ✅ Webhook signature verification (fixed using Hono `c.req.text()`)
3. ✅ All webhook events returning 200: checkout.completed, subscription.updated, payment.succeeded
4. ✅ Database tier upgrade verified (tier=enterprise, subscription_status=active)
5. ✅ Customer Portal access and subscription cancellation
6. ✅ Cancel_at_period_end behavior confirmed (tier stays active until subscription_ends_at)

**Documentation**:
- `scripts/README.md`: 200+ line guide with 6-step setup, troubleshooting, test cards, production deployment
- `scripts/test-stripe-checkout.sh`: Automated prerequisite checker (validates API, web app, database, env vars)
- `.env.example`: Reorganized Stripe section with numbered steps

### Migration Path

**Immediate** (completed):
1. ✅ Run migration `0005_add_stripe_subscription_fields.sql`
2. ✅ Configure Stripe test keys in `.env`
3. ✅ Create Pro/Enterprise products in Stripe Dashboard
4. ✅ Set up Stripe CLI webhook forwarding for local dev
5. ✅ Configure Customer Portal in Stripe Dashboard
6. ✅ Deploy API with subscription routes

**Future Enhancements**:
- Add `stripe_webhook_events` table for idempotency tracking (event_id unique constraint)
- Create `pricing_plans` table to map price IDs → tiers dynamically
- Implement grace period check: validate `subscription_ends_at` before downgrading tier
- Add webhook event logging/audit trail (track all events, not just processed ones)
- Expose quota usage API endpoint: `GET /api/users/me/quota` showing current usage vs limit
- Add proactive email alerts when subscription payment fails
- Implement one-click trial upgrades (14-day free trial for Pro tier)
- Terraform or script for automated Stripe product/price setup

**Production Deployment Checklist**:
1. Set production Stripe API keys (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` from live mode)
2. Create production webhook endpoint: `https://api.yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Configure `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` from production endpoint
4. Create live mode products and prices, update `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID` and `STRIPE_ENTERPRISE_PRICE_ID`
5. Test production checkout with real payment method
6. Monitor webhook delivery in Stripe Dashboard
7. Set up alerts for failed webhook deliveries
8. Document subscription management process for support team

### Security Considerations

**Webhook Signature Verification**:
- CRITICAL: All webhook requests must verify `stripe-signature` header
- Uses Stripe SDK's `webhooks.constructEvent()` with shared secret
- Prevents attackers from spoofing subscription events (e.g., fake upgrades)
- Test: Send invalid signature → expect 400 error

**Customer Data Isolation**:
- Stripe customer ID stored per user (not shared)
- Subscription endpoints require authentication (Better Auth)
- Only authenticated user can access their own checkout/portal URLs
- No admin endpoints to modify other users' subscriptions (future feature)

**API Key Scope**:
- Stripe secret key has full account access (stored in environment variables only)
- Webhook secret is endpoint-specific (different for test vs production)
- No keys exposed in client-side code (web app calls API, API calls Stripe)

### Error Handling

**Webhook Processing**:
- Signature verification failures → 400 response (Stripe retries)
- Missing metadata.userId → early return with warning log (graceful degradation)
- Database errors → 500 response (Stripe retries with exponential backoff)
- Unknown event types → log + return 200 (ignore gracefully)

**Checkout/Portal Creation**:
- User not found → throw error (caught by API route, returns 404)
- Missing Stripe customer ID → throw error (return 400 "No active subscription")
- Stripe API errors → bubble up to API route (return 500 with error message)

**Rate Limiting**:
- No rate limiting on webhook endpoint (Stripe signature verification is primary protection)
- Future: Consider 100 requests/minute per IP if abuse occurs
