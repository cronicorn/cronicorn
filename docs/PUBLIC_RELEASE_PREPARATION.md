# Public Release Preparation - Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to prepare the repository for public release.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Organization

**Moved files from root to docs folder:**
- `CORE_SERVICE_RESEARCH.md` → `docs/archive/CORE_SERVICE_RESEARCH.md`
  - Internal research document about service architecture
  - Moved to archive since it's historical planning documentation
  
- `CUSTOMER_OVERVIEW.md` → `docs/CUSTOMER_OVERVIEW.md`
  - Customer-facing product overview
  - Kept in main docs folder as it's useful for understanding the product

### 2. Environment Configuration Standardization

**Removed redundant app-specific .env files:**
- Deleted `apps/api/.env.example` (duplicated root config with outdated values)
- Deleted `apps/api/.env.production.example` (duplicated root config with outdated values)

**Rationale:** The monorepo uses a centralized `.env` file via `dotenv-cli` (see root `package.json` scripts). App-specific .env files were:
- Redundant with root configuration
- Out of sync (using port 3000 vs correct port 3333)
- Creating confusion about which config to use

**Updated root .env files:**
- `.env.example`: Added proper `VITE_API_URL` configuration for web app
- `.env.production.example`: Added Stripe configuration and `VITE_API_URL`
- `.env.test`: Added clarifying comment about automatic usage by test suite

**Created documentation:**
- Added `apps/api/ENV_README.md` to explain the shared .env pattern and why there's no local .env file

### 3. Repository Metadata

**Added LICENSE file:**
- Created ISC license file matching the license declared in `package.json`
- Standard open-source license allowing free use, modification, and distribution

**Updated README.md:**
- Changed `git clone <repository-url>` placeholder to actual repository URL
- Changed directory name from `cron-mvp` to `mvpmvp` to match actual repo

### 4. Security Review

**Verified no sensitive data in repository:**
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets or API keys (all use environment variables)
- ✅ `.gitignore` properly excludes `.env` files and sensitive data
- ✅ No database dumps or backup files
- ✅ No private credentials in test files (only test placeholders)
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows properly use `secrets.*` variables
- ✅ No screenshots or images containing sensitive data

**Configuration files reviewed:**
- All config files use `process.env.*` for sensitive values
- No hardcoded database URLs or API keys found
- Test files use proper test placeholders

### 5. Documentation Quality

**Files reviewed for internal references:**
- ✅ README.md - Updated, no internal-only information
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md - Auto-generated, appropriate for public
- ✅ docs/contributing.md - References actual repo URL (appropriate)
- ✅ docs/TODO.md - Development planning, appropriate for public
- ✅ .github/instructions/ - Development guidelines, helpful for contributors
- ✅ .github/chatmodes/ - GitHub Copilot configuration, helpful for contributors

## Remaining Considerations

### Optional Future Work
1. **Add SECURITY.md** - For responsible vulnerability disclosure
2. **Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Community standards
3. **Add PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md** - Standardize PR process
4. **Review docs/TODO.md** - Consider if any items should be converted to GitHub Issues

### Repository Settings (Manual Steps)
When making the repository public, ensure:
1. Repository visibility is set to "Public"
2. GitHub Pages is configured if needed
3. Branch protection rules are set for `main`
4. Required status checks are configured
5. GitHub Discussions enabled if desired
