# Cronicorn Landing Page Content & Structure

## 🎯 Page Goal
Convert visitors from **"What is this?"** to **"I need this"** within 10 seconds, then drive them to sign up or request early access.

---

## 1. Hero Section

### Goal
Instant clarity + emotional hook. Visitor should understand the value prop and feel compelled to learn more.

### Headline Options
**Primary (Recommended):**
> **Never Miss the Perfect Moment to Run Your Code**

**Alternatives:**
- "Your Jobs Deserve a Smarter Scheduler"
- "Stop Fighting Your Scheduler. Let It Adapt to You."
- "Intelligent Job Scheduling That Adapts to Your Reality"

### Subheadline
> Cronicorn is an AI-powered HTTP job scheduler that automatically adjusts monitoring frequency, activates investigation tools, and attempts recovery—without waking your team at 3 AM.

### Visual/Animation Idea
**Interactive Timeline Animation:**
- Show a health check endpoint with a fixed schedule (every 5 minutes)
- Then show it detecting issues → automatically tightening to 30 seconds → activating diagnostic tools → recovering → relaxing back to baseline
- Use subtle color transitions: green (healthy) → yellow (detecting) → red (critical) → blue (investigating) → green (recovered)

### Primary CTA
```
[Get Early Access] (Blue, prominent)
[Watch Demo] (Secondary, outline)
```

### Trust Signal
Small text below CTAs: "Built by engineers, for engineers. Join 100+ teams in early access."

## 2. The Problem Statement

### Goal
Make visitors nod along: "Yes, I feel this pain daily."

### Headline
> **Your Systems Don't Run in a Vacuum**

### Copy (2 columns)

**Column 1: The Pain**
- Traffic surges without warning
- Systems slow down under load
- APIs have transient failures
- Traditional schedulers don't care

**Column 2: The Result**
- ❌ Wasted resources during quiet times
- ❌ Missed critical signals during incidents
- ❌ Alert fatigue from notification spam
- ❌ Manual schedule adjustments at 3 AM

### Visual
Split-screen comparison:
- Left: Rigid cron jobs running at fixed intervals regardless of conditions
- Right: Cronicorn adapting in real-time to system state

## 3. The Solution (How It Works)

### Goal
Clear, simple explanation without overwhelming with technical details.

### Headline
> **Intelligent Scheduling in 4 Steps**

### Step Cards (Horizontal Flow)

**1. Define Your Jobs**
- Icon: 📝
- Set up HTTP endpoints with baseline schedules
- Health checks, data pipelines, automation tasks

**2. We Execute & Learn**
- Icon: 🔄
- Track success rates, response times, patterns
- Build understanding of normal vs. abnormal

**3. AI Adapts**
- Icon: 🧠

### Visual
Animated flowchart showing:
```
Health Check Fails 
    ↓
Frequency Increases (30s instead of 5m)
    ↓
Investigation Tool Activates
    ↓
Root Cause Found
    ↓
Recovery Attempted
    ↓
Alert Only If Recovery Fails
```

## 4. Concrete Example (Flash Sale Scenario)

### Goal
Help visitor visualize exactly how this works in their world.

### Headline
> **See It In Action: E-Commerce Flash Sale**

### Timeline (Interactive)

**Before Sale (Baseline)**
- Traffic monitor: Every 5 minutes
- Order processing: Every 3 minutes
- Diagnostics: **Paused**

**↓ Sale Launches - Traffic Surges 5×**

**Cronicorn Automatically:**
1. ✅ Tightens monitoring (5m → 30s)
2. ✅ Alerts team with quick heads-up
3. ✅ Activates page analyzer (was paused)
4. ✅ Warms cache for slow products
5. ✅ Monitors recovery

**What You Didn't Do:**
- ❌ Manually adjust schedules
- ❌ Remember to activate diagnostics
- ❌ Trigger cache warming
- ❌ Get paged for auto-fixed issues

### CTA

## 11. FAQ Section

### Goal
Address common concerns before they become blockers.

### Questions (Expandable)

**What types of jobs can I schedule?**
Anything triggered by HTTP requests: health checks, webhooks, data pipelines, notifications, batch processing, automation.

**How does AI make scheduling decisions?**
Analyzes success rates, response times, and failure patterns. Applies proven strategies like tightening during degradation, pausing during persistent failures, activating diagnostics when needed.

**Can I disable AI and use fixed schedules?**
Yes. Use as traditional scheduler, enable AI only for specific endpoints, or set strict bounds AI respects.

**What happens if AI makes a bad decision?**
AI hints have TTL and auto-expire. You set min/max intervals AI cannot violate. Manual overrides always take priority.

**How reliable is the scheduler?**
Distributed architecture, idempotent execution, graceful degradation, transaction guarantees. AI failure doesn't stop job execution.

**Can I self-host?**
On our roadmap. Join early access to influence priorities.
