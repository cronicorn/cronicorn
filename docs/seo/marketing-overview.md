## 💡 Key Messaging

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"Cronicorn is an AI-powered job scheduler that automatically adapts to your system's reality. Instead of checking everything at the same pace regardless of what's happening, it tightens monitoring during incidents, activates investigation tools, attempts recovery, and only alerts when human intervention is truly needed. Teams reduce alert fatigue by 80% and resolve issues 10x faster."

### One-Liner
"Intelligent job scheduling that adapts to your reality."

### Value Props (Pick 3)
