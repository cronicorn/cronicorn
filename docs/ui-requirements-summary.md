## The Plan at a Glance

### What We're Building

**9 New Pages:**
1. `/dashboard` - Central hub showing all jobs
2. `/jobs/new` - Create job form
3. `/jobs/:id` - Job details with endpoints list
4. `/jobs/:jobId/endpoints/new` - Add endpoint form
5. `/jobs/:jobId/endpoints/:id/edit` - Edit endpoint configuration
6. `/endpoints/:id/runs` - Execution history
7. `/endpoints/:id/health` - Health metrics
8. `/runs/:id` - Detailed run information
9. `/settings/api-keys` - API key management

**15-20 Reusable Components:**
- `JobCard`, `EndpointRow`, `RunStatusBadge`
- `LoadingSpinner`, `ErrorMessage`, `EmptyState`
- `DeleteConfirmDialog`, `CopyButton`, `CodeBlock`
- And more...

### What We're NOT Building

❌ Advanced analytics and charts  
❌ AI control interface (works automatically)  
❌ Team collaboration features  
❌ Job templates or bulk operations  
❌ Visual workflow builder  
❌ Custom dashboards  

**Rationale:** Every excluded feature either:
- Adds complexity without MVP value
- Can be built post-launch based on user feedback
- Is not required for core workflows

---

## Core User Workflows Supported

### 1. First-Time User Setup (< 5 minutes)
```
Sign up → Dashboard → Create job → Add endpoint → See first run
```

### 2. Monitor Job Health (< 2 minutes)
```
Dashboard → Failed job → Health page → Run details → Debug error
```

### 3. Upgrade Plan (< 3 clicks)
```
Dashboard → Upgrade CTA → Pricing → Stripe Checkout → Settings confirmation
```

### 4. Programmatic Access (< 2 minutes)
```
Settings → API Keys → Generate → Copy key → Use in API call
```

---

## Why This is Minimal

### Current Backend (Already Complete)
- ✅ 17 public-facing API endpoints
- ✅ Full authentication (OAuth + API keys)
- ✅ Stripe subscription system
- ✅ Job scheduling engine
- ✅ Run history tracking

### Current Frontend (Basic Shell)
- ✅ Landing page
- ✅ Login/register flows
- ✅ Pricing page with Stripe checkout
- ✅ Basic settings page

### The Gap (What's Missing)
- ❌ No way to create/manage jobs without API
- ❌ No visibility into job execution
- ❌ No monitoring or debugging interface
- ❌ No API key management UI

**This plan fills ONLY the critical gaps.** Every feature enables a must-have user action.

---

## Technical Strategy

### Frontend Stack (Use What We Have)
- **Framework:** React with TanStack Router (already installed)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (already configured)
- **Auth:** Better Auth client (already integrated)
- **State:** Route loaders + React useState (no Redux/Zustand)
- **API:** Simple fetch wrapper with credentials

### Key Principles
1. **No new dependencies** unless absolutely necessary
2. **Server as source of truth** - refetch after mutations
3. **Simple forms** - HTML5 validation + server errors
4. **Mobile-first** - responsive by default
5. **Accessibility** - WCAG AA compliance

### Performance Targets
- Page load: < 2 seconds
- Time to interactive: < 3 seconds
- Works offline: Not required for MVP
- Bundle size: < 500 KB (pre-gzip)

---

## Implementation Timeline

**Total:** 3-4 weeks (single developer)

### Week 1: Foundation & Core Management
- Dashboard with jobs list
- Create/view/edit job pages
- Basic navigation and layout

**Deliverable:** Users can manage jobs

### Week 2: Endpoint Configuration
- Add/edit endpoint forms
- Pause/resume controls
- Delete with confirmation

**Deliverable:** Users can configure HTTP endpoints

### Week 3: Monitoring & Debugging
- Run history list
- Run details page
- Health summary page

**Deliverable:** Users can debug failures

### Week 4: Developer Tools & Polish
- API key management
- Quota usage display
- Responsive design
- Cross-browser testing

**Deliverable:** Production-ready UI

---

## Success Metrics

**MVP launch is successful if:**

1. ✅ New user can create first job in < 5 minutes
2. ✅ User can debug failed job in < 5 minutes
3. ✅ User can upgrade plan in < 3 clicks
4. ✅ User can generate API key in < 2 minutes
5. ✅ No critical bugs or security issues
6. ✅ Works on mobile and desktop
7. ✅ At least 3 beta users complete all workflows

**Technical metrics:**
- Page load < 2 seconds
- Zero JavaScript console errors
- API calls < 500ms
- Mobile responsive (320px - 1920px)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks

**1. Scope creep** ("Can we add just one more feature?")
- **Mitigation:** Every new request must answer: "Does this block a core workflow?" If no, defer to post-MVP.

**2. API changes during UI development**
- **Mitigation:** API is stable (17 endpoints tested). If changes needed, coordinate with backend team first.

**3. Design perfectionism**
- **Mitigation:** Ship functional first, polish incrementally. Tailwind defaults are "good enough" for MVP.

**4. Testing bottleneck**
- **Mitigation:** Test incrementally during development. Phase 7-8 are dedicated to final testing and polish.

### Contingency Plans

**If behind schedule:**
1. Defer API key management (use API docs for now)
2. Defer health summary page (run details are sufficient)
3. Reduce polish time (ship with basic styling)

**If ahead of schedule:**
1. Add job cloning feature
2. Build simple usage graphs
3. Improve empty states with illustrations

## Post-MVP Roadmap (Based on User Feedback)

After launching with this minimal UI, prioritize next features based on:

1. **User requests** - What do users ask for most?
2. **Pain points** - Where do users struggle?
3. **Engagement** - Which features are used most?
4. **Business goals** - What drives conversions?

**Potential enhancements:**
- Analytics dashboards with charts
- Job templates and cloning
- Advanced filtering and search
- Team collaboration features
- Custom AI control interface
- Bulk operations
- Export/import functionality

**Don't build these until users ask for them.**

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review & Approve** - Stakeholders review these three documents
2. **Adjust if Needed** - Make any final scope changes
3. **Begin Phase 1** - Start with dashboard and shared components
4. **Weekly Check-ins** - Demo progress, adjust course as needed
5. **Ship Incrementally** - Deploy features as they're completed

---

## Questions & Feedback

**Have questions about the plan?**
- Open an issue with label `ui-planning`
- Discuss in team meeting
- Comment directly on planning docs

**Think something is missing?**
- Ask: "Does this block a core workflow?"
- If yes → add to requirements
- If no → add to post-MVP backlog

**Think something is too much?**
- Challenge: "Can users succeed without this?"
- If yes → move to post-MVP
- If no → keep in MVP scope
