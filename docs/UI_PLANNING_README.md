## 🎓 Key Principles

### 1. Minimal but Complete

Every feature included directly supports a core user workflow. Nothing more, nothing less.

### 2. Ship Fast, Iterate Based on Feedback

Don't build features users haven't asked for. Launch with essentials, improve based on real usage.

### 3. Use What We Have

Leverage existing infrastructure (TanStack Router, Tailwind, Better Auth). No new frameworks.

### 4. Simple Over Clever

Boring, proven solutions win. No premature optimization or over-engineering.

### 5. Functional First, Polish Later

Ship working software. Improve UX incrementally.
