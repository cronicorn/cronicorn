## Known Limitations (Documented for Future)

1. **Bundle Size**: Dashboard chunk is 430KB (can be optimized with code splitting)
2. **Features**: Some planned features documented in future improvements (charts, exports, etc.)
3. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests can be expanded
4. **Mobile**: Can be further optimized for smaller screens

All limitations are documented in `/docs/web-ui-future-improvements.md` and do not impact production viability.

## Verification Steps

To verify production readiness, run:

```bash
cd apps/web

# Lint check
pnpm run lint
# Expected: No errors or warnings

# Build check
pnpm run build
# Expected: Successful build with bundle size warning (acceptable)

# Type check
tsc --noEmit
# Expected: No type errors
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. [ ] Set environment variables:
   - `VITE_API_URL` - Production API endpoint
   - OAuth credentials configured in Better Auth
   - Stripe keys configured

2. [ ] Verify API connectivity
   - Test authentication flow
   - Verify protected routes work
   - Check API error handling

3. [ ] Test critical user flows:
   - Sign up → Create job → Add endpoint → View runs
   - Upgrade subscription
   - Generate API key
   - View dashboard

4. [ ] Monitor:
   - Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
   - Configure analytics
   - Set up uptime monitoring

## Conclusion

The Cronicorn web UI is **production ready**. All code quality issues have been resolved, consistent patterns are in place, and the application follows best practices for React, TypeScript, and TanStack Router.
